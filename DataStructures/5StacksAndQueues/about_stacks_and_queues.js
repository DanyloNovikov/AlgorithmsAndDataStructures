// they can be implement similar way
// Stacks and Queues they are liniar data structures (one by one);
// they have only one different it is how they are remove

// Stack:
// Stack it is like plates for example:
// Staking plates on top of each other
// and if we want to take some data firstly we must
// take first data in for example array
// it is called LIFO - Last In First Out
// because the last item what cames in is the first one cames out

// example how someone use Stacks:
// broser history

// methods for stack:
// lookup: O(n)
// pop: O(1) // remove the last plate
// push: O(1) // add a new plate
// peek: O(1) // view the top most plate

// Queues:
// Example: the first person that in the line gets to go first then second person and etc
// it is oposits of stacks. FIFO - First In First Out

// methods for queues
// lookup: O(n)
// enqueue: O(1) // ad item to the queue end
// dequeue: O(1) // remove first element from the queues
// peek:    O(1) // return the first person from the list
